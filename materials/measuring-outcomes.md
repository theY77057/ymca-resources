# Measuring Outcomes
(source: http://strengtheningnonprofits.org/resources/guidebooks/MeasuringOutcomes.pdf)
## Why Measure Outcomes?

1. Measuring the effectiveness of an intervention. 
2. Identifying effective practices.
3. Identifying practices that need improvement. 
4. Proving your value to existing and potential funders. 
5. Getting clarity and consensus around the purpose of your program. 

## Where Should We Focus?
In starting out, it’s particularly important not to try to measure too much. Start slowly and learn from your experience. Don’t try to perform outcome measurement at the same time. Pick one program or service as a beginning. Questions that will help you figure out where to begin include:

- Do you have a new program with an unproven track record? 
- Do you have an existing service with shaky performance?
- Do you have an effective program that you want to document as being so?

## What Do We Want to Accomplish with Our Outcome Measurement Efforts?

There are often a variety of reasons underlying the decision to carry out outcome measurement related to your programs. Which options below apply most directly to the program you intend to examine?

- To identify what constitutes success for a program and how it will achieve that success (often as part of a program design process prior to funding and implementation)
- To determine whether the program theory underlying the program is correct (often as part of a program redesign when new research indicates that the assumptions underlying the program cannot be substantiated)
- To describe how you intend to measure a program or service’s impacts (often as part of a funding request)
- To report on a program’s impact (often as part of a staff or board planning process)
- To determine whether the program has been effective in achieving its intended outcomes (often as part of a funder’s request for evidence that the program merits continued funding)
- To determine whether to continue the program and allocate ongoing funding (often as part of internal budget-related priority setting)
- To make improvements in how the program is delivered (often as part of a program-wide or organizationwide quality improvement effort)

### Who is on Our Outcome Measurement Team?

Developing an outcome measurement plan will likely take a number of months. For organizations first learning outcome measurement, it may take as long as three years to develop a comprehensive, smoothly running outcome measurement system. The first year may be a learning year, with the second devoted to testing your systems. It may not be until the third year of data collection that staff sense the results are valid and meaningful. It may take you much less time, but be patient! United Way of America’s Measuring Program Outcomes manual includes a section on timing and a template you can use to lay out a timeline for your outcome measurement work.
