### Gold Card
The [Harris Health Financial Assistance Program](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/default.aspx)  (known colloquially as the "Gold Card") is a healthcare discount.
- Eligibility Office: 713 566 6509, dial 4 then 1 
	- Tips for the phone call:
		- You'll probably talk to Troy, the supervisor.
		- Ask for the **application number** and the **eligibility counselor**.
		- Find out the **[eligibility location](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/eligibility-locations.aspx)** that's handling the case.
- [Harris Health Contact Information](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/contact-us/pages/default.aspx)
- [Applications](https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/eligibility/applicant-forms/English/application-instructions-english.pdf) are mailed to P.O. Box 300488 Houston TX 77230
- The applications *require* many supporting documents (but *not* the Medicare assets form). It's easiest to apply for single adults. If possible, include as few household members on the application as possible. For *every* household member, Harris Health will ask for a proof of familial relations---these documents can be tricky to locate in time if a client has a serious medical need. 
	- proof of identity
		- government issued photo ID
	- proof of gross income (last 30 days)
		- statement of support,
		- wage verification form, or
		- ALL paystubs dated within 30 days.
	- proof of residence
		- lease no older than 1 year or
		- residence verification form
	- proof of immigration status
		- *employment authorization document* or
		- *permanent resident card*
	- proof of familial relation (if applicable)
		- birth certificates for children
		- declaration of marriage
		- marriage license

### County Indigent Health Care
- The [income requirements](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/cihcp/eligibility.shtm) are steep.
- *Encourage your clients to live in Harris County.*

### Healthcare through the Affordable Care Act
Healthcare through the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/affordable-care-act/) for individuals living between 100% FPL and 400% FPL (1 month turnaround).
- You can [screen](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/) your client to see if they're eligible.
- You can complete an application online (90 minutes) or over the phone (3 hours and *very challenging*).
	- These applications require almost as much information as an income tax return.
	- You should enter each household member's social security number.
	- Try to be as rigorous as possible about the people living in the household.
- Be mindful of policy changes due to the [American Health Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017#Comparison_between_ACA_and_AHCA).
