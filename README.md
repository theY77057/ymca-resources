After a home-fire, Danielle Bolks, MSW suggests:
> My thought is to reach out to the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/home-fire-recovery).
The Red Cross has a large [emergency preparedness/response website](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/).

# Rental Assistance
If your client needs rental assistance, you should immediately apply at GCCSA. Then you should filter for "rent" on the [Emergency Assistance Matrix](https://github.com/ColtonGrainger/ymca-resources/blob/master/materials/emergency-assistance.xlsx) and contact agencies that serve your client's zip code.

# Healthcare

## Primary Care Providers (PCPs)
- Here's a [Map of Primary Care Providers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kk9yn6-4nifHLIf2tGYbW_7PiYo&usp=sharing) (share & edit!)

### [Advice for doctor's appointments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amino/2016/03/12/how-to-make-every-minute-count-at-your-doctors-appointment/print/) 
adapted from Sabrina Kang's 3/12/2016 *Forbes* article
- **Prepare a list of questions.**
- **Know [your client's] medications** or, even better, bring them to the appointment. 
- **Be honest.** If there’s a stressful thing happening at work or home that’s preventing [your client] from sticking to their medications, diet or exercise, *share that information.* 
- **Figure out next steps.** Wrap up your appointment with an understanding of what your client need to do next. Repeat it aloud.
- **Get a visit summary (and a copy of any referrals).** A written record or an after-visit summary makes it more likely that your client will get their concerns addressed by the next visit. It's also proof that your client is *actively* seeking treatment for their medical conditions.

## Healthcare Coverage
### [Medicaid](https://hhs.texas.gov/services/questions-about-your-benefits) is a [federal program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid) administered by Texas Health and Human Services.
- Traditional Medicaid & Children's Medicaid
	- [Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership](http://www.tmhp.com/Pages/default.aspx)

### Gold Card
The [Harris Health Financial Assistance Program](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/default.aspx)  (known colloquially as the "Gold Card") is a healthcare discount.
- Eligibility Office: 713 566 6509, dial 4 then 1 
	- Tips for the phone call:
		- You'll probably talk to Troy, the supervisor.
		- Ask for the **application number** and the **eligibility counselor**.
		- Find out the **[eligibility location](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/patients/access-care/eligibility-card/pages/eligibility-locations.aspx)** that's handling the case.
- [Harris Health Contact Information](https://www.harrishealth.org/en/contact-us/pages/default.aspx)
- [Applications](https://www.harrishealth.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/eligibility/applicant-forms/English/application-instructions-english.pdf) are mailed to P.O. Box 300488 Houston TX 77230
- The applications *require* many supporting documents (but *not* the Medicare assets form). It's easiest to apply for single adults. If possible, include as few household members on the application as possible. For *every* household member, Harris Health will ask for a proof of familial relations---these documents can be tricky to locate in time if a client has a serious medical need. 
	- proof of identity
		- government issued photo ID
	- proof of gross income (last 30 days)
		- statement of support,
		- wage verification form, or
		- ALL paystubs dated within 30 days.

		- lease no older than 1 year or
		- residence verification form
	- proof of immigration status
		- *employment authorization document* or
		- *permanent resident card*

		- birth certificates for children
		- declaration of marriage

- You can [screen](https://www.healthcare.gov/screener/) your client to see if they're eligible.
- You can complete an application online (90 minutes) or over the phone (3 hours and *very challenging*).
	- These applications require almost as much information as an income tax return.
	- You should enter each household member's social security number.
	- Try to be as rigorous as possible about the people living in the household.
- Be mindful of policy changes due to the [American Health Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Health_Care_Act_of_2017#Comparison_between_ACA_and_AHCA).
